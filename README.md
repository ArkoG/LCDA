## the MOD

This mod has a small scale and detailled map of the region of the Alps. It aims to re-focus the gameplay into the characters instead of world-conquest that base game is very prone to. 
A lot of the gameplay mechanics reside in the "Les 3 Tours" mod that I am developing aside. "La Couronne Des Alpes" will of course come with its own specific mechanics and its detailled historical setup. 

## the reasons why

I chose a detailled setup because for me fits better this character-based game such as Crusader Kings II instead of a very large map. 
The choice of the region is based on my likings obvioulsy (I grew up in Savoy), but it is also region with an interesting historical setup, pretty unique in western Europe.
At a time where most future countries already exist (France, Germany, England... ) the Alpine region, after the fall of the last burgundian kingdom in 1032 is an open box of opportunities that see a lot of local power rising (Savoie, Dauphiné, Swiss confederacy...).
The importance of geography, like unpassable mountains bringing an additional layer to strategy, passes which are important for trade provide some golden keys to your economy. 

### mod's history

- A first attempt was made with Crusader kings I, hell modding the map for this game was a pain.
- I started to work on this mod in 2012, a few monthes after the game was released. I actually some more free time to mod. 
- the mod resisted more or less the various game updates over the years - currently the mod is playable, but at an alpha state
- A lot of my development ressources had been put in my other project "Les 3 Tours" (L3T). For that project I teamed up with Mouchi and we create a nice mod that brings dynamic trade, cathedral and a lot of flavour features.
L3T is actually partly derived from LCDA and represents a big part of its gameplay. L3T, even though it works with vanilla map is actually a requirement to play LCDA. 
- now that vanilla game evolves at a much slower pace, it opens more time to focus on developping the mod instead of constantly upgrading for comptatibility sake to follow the base game.
